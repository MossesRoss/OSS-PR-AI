✨ Add `flutter generate` command for scaffolding widgets and screens ## Description closes #179059  This PR introduces a new `flutter generate` command that allows developers to quickly scaffold Flutter widgets and screens from the command line  similar to Angular's `ng generate` command. This feature significantly improves developer productivity by eliminating the need to manually create files through the IDE file explorer.  ## Motivation  When building Flutter applications  developers frequently need to create new widgets and screens. The current workflow typically involves: 1. Using the mouse to navigate the file explorer in VS Code 2. Right-clicking to create a new file 3. Typing the filename 4. Writing boilerplate code manually  This is time-consuming and breaks the flow of development. Having built applications with Angular (another Google open-source project)  I found the `ng generate` command extremely helpful  and I believe Flutter developers would benefit from similar functionality.  **Additional Benefits:** - **AI Agent Integra,0,2

Remove semantics geometry shortcircuit Fixes https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/173097  The semantics flush is ~200 μs slower with the shortcuircut removed  + #177477 (which reduces the time increase by ~ 100 μs  from 876 μs to 773 μs) I tried to introduce caching in [a different patch](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/compare/master...LongCatIsLooong:semantics-geometry?expand=1) but that patch is more risky and still needs a cleanup.  773 μs doesn't seem bad considering there were little to no geometry updates between frames before the fix. Introducing cache currently only improves `Semantics.ensureGeometry` by less than 100 μs and is much more risky / harder to ensure the correctness.  ### BEFORE ``` [bench_material3_scroll_semantics] name: bench_material3_scroll_semantics SEMANTICS: (samples: 98 clean/2 outliers/100 measured/300 total)  | average: 567.0510204081633 μs  | outlier average: 799 μs  | outlier/clean ratio: 1.4090442856885785x  | noise: 13.95%  Semantics.updateChildren: (samples: 91 cle,1,5

Dynamically set MinimumOSVersion in App.framework Currently  the MinimumOSVersion in App.framework/Info.plist is sourced from a static template file created during flutter create. This value can become out of sync with the -miphoneos-version-min flag used to compile the App.framework binary  especially after a Flutter SDK upgrade. This mismatch can lead to App Store submission warnings or rejections.  This change fixes the issue by making the build process the single source of truth for the MinimumOSVersion.  Fixes #176313   *If you had to change anything in the [flutter/tests] repo  include a link to the migration guide as per the [breaking change policy].*  ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page  which explains my responsibilities. - [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide]  including [Features we expect every widget to implement]. - [x] I signed the [CLA]. - [x] I listed at least one is,1,7

Add SliverIndexedVariedExtentList to support jumpToIndex Related: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/12319 https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/81005   This PR adds a new sliver named `SliverIndexedVariedExtentList` which takes an `itemExtentBuilder`  an `anchor` index and an `indexedScrollController` which has `jumpToIndex` and `animateToIndex` methods. There is also an `itemPositionsListener` that can listen to index positions on the viewport.  I think this is a good idea in general but I'm hoping to get some feedback on the API early as mentioned in the [guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#when).  At a high level this basically follows the idea by @gaaclarke in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/12319#issuecomment-546038123. Since Flutter viewports deal in pixel offsets  if we want to jump to an index we need to be able to convert indices to offsets. This functionality was actually added in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/131393 to support an `itemExtentB,0,6
